    "OOP lenguages have some notion of access control. Attributes and methods of an object can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Private**: only that object can access them.\n",
    "* **Protected**: only that class and subclasses can access them.\n",
    "* **Public**: any other object can access them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't do this. Technically, all methods and attributes on a class are publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, we should also prefix an internal attribute or method with an underscore character, \\_. There is nothing inside the interpreter to stop from accessing it. It's just a warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a stronger warning we can underscore the attribute or method twice \\_\\_. This is known as **name mangling**, attributes and methods can still be called by outside objects but is an indicator that we want the attribute to remain private. "

Finally, we use one of the last two lines (depending on the operating system, as indicated in the comments) to activate the environment. We'll need to execute this line each time we want to use that particular virtualenv, and then use the command `deactivate` when we are done working on this project.\n",
